Project: OpenDMTP Reference Implementation - Java server
URL    : http://www.opendmtp.org
File   : CHANGELOG.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.4
- NEW: Now includes a build target for creating a Servlet WAR file for delivering
       CSV, or KML(XML), formatted records over the web.  KML formatted records can
       be imported directly into Google Earth (which also automatically retrieve
       periodic updates to the data) so that as new records come in to the MySQL
       database, they will automatically be updated in Google Earth.
- NEW: MySQL datastore server now has better error checking.
- NEW: The build-in logging facility has been updated with some additional features
       and provides an easier path for eventually porting to Log4J.

Version 1.1.3
- NEW: Now includes support for extracting events from the 'Device' MySQL table into 
       a file in Google Earth's "kml" (XML) format.  This file can then be loaded 
       and viewed in Google Earth.

Version 1.1.2
- BUG: Added a comment about the use of the JavaMail api.  Also, renamed the source
       file "SendMail.java" to "SendMail.java.save" to allow the compiling without 
       JavaMail api support.
- NEW: Minor changes to the MySQL dabase support.

Version 1.1.1
- NEW: Now Includes support for MySQL data store.
- NEW: Added "STATUS_INITIALIZED" and "STATUS_WAYMARK" to the OpenDMTP protocol.

       implementation.

       accounting.
